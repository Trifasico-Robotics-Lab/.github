# 🤖 Trifasico-Robotics-Lab

Welcome to **Trifasico Robotics Lab** — a research space exploring **Reinforcement Learning**, **Control**, and **Simulation for Mobile & Collaborative Robots**.  
Our projects involve **Isaac Sim**, **Isaac Lab**, **ROS 2**, and real-world robotic systems.

---

## 🌱 Research Focus

We study how robots can **learn to move, navigate, cooperate, and adapt** in dynamic human-centered environments.

Current themes include:

- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robots**
- 🏃 **Locomotion & Navigation Policies in Simulation**
- 🤝 **Human–Robot Interaction & Collaboration**
- 🔄 **Sim-to-Real Transfer Strategies**
- 🦾 **Autonomous Control for Service & Assistive Robots**

## 📂 Repository Structure

This organization hosts multiple smaller project repos, typically structured as:
```
project-name/
├─ envs/ # Isaac Lab environments
├─ training/ # RL scripts & policy optimization
├─ models/ # Saved agents & checkpoints
├─ scripts/ # Experiment automation
├─ assets/ # Simulation meshes/textures
└─ README.md # Usage + documentation
```

Each repository is self-contained to ensure **reproducibility and clarity** over time.

## 🧭 Goals & Philosophy

We aim to:

1. Develop **robust learning-based control** for mobile robots.
2. Enable **scalable simulation workflows** for research iteration.
3. Bridge the gap between **simulation and real-world deployment**.
4. Share open, reproducible, and well-organized research code.

Scientific rigor and clarity are core values.
